        Hello there, I'm Benjamin Reit from Sioux Falls,
        South Dakota. I've lived here my entire life. I've
        spent the last decade working for a wonderful
        company Lifescape. I picked up coding Feburary 2021
        when my friends who had been doing it for some time
        talked me into starting.
        <br />
        I've always enjoyed computer games and figuring out
        how things work. It has served me very well
        programming. I've been an avid player of Magic the
        Gathering for the last 15 years and until they
        changed the Judge program I was an official judge
        for the game. If you are familiar with the game
        you'll know the rule set can be as complex as
        programming is sometimes.
