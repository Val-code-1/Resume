        Hello there, I'm Benjamin Reit from Sioux Falls,
        South Dakota. I've lived here my entire life. I've
        spent the last decade working for a wonderful
        company Lifescape. I picked up coding Feburary 2021
        when my friends who had been doing it for some time
        talked me into starting. My teacher Dustin is
        awesome!
